# How it works ?

![Full process](/img/full_process.png)

To retrieve information about a tire through the Tire Information Service, an end-user application needs to go through
the above process, which can be split in 3 steps:

1. ONS Resolution
   
2. Authentication (optional: Only required when private data needs to be shared)
   
3. API call to a tire manufacturer


GDSOâ€™s service is mainly involved in the first two steps (Resolution and Authentication). The last one is
managed between the customer and the appropriate tire maker.
This document will describe in more details how to go through all steps in the sections below.
