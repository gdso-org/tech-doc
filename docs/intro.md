# Introduction

This guide aims at helping users who desire to implement ```Tire Information Service```. Starting
from the capture of a tire identifier (SGTIN-96), it will describe how to go through the different steps that will
lead to retrieve data associated with the item.

The objective is not to give a fully detailed presentation of the Tire Information Service, its features and its
goal, but rather a pragmatic help on how to implement and use it.

Additionally, a guideline with best practices on how to design and implement a new API (Application
Programming Interface) to serve tire information data can be found in this document.
